# Text-justifier
This is one of the 3 tasks that we were given in one of my first-year subject.

We had to create a text justifier. The user gives an unformatted text(T) and the line length(X) and doing: “for l in justifica_texto(T, X): print(l)” would output the formatted text, where each line has X length. This was one of my first projects, so I wasn’t used to debugging or commenting my code. My main difficulty was in the “insere_espacos” function where we had to add spaces from left to right in a evenly way until the length given was reached (…).
